# Android Build Fix - Core Library Desugaring

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### Problem
```
Dependency ':flutter_local_notifications' requires core library desugaring to be enabled for :app.
```

### Root Cause
The `flutter_local_notifications` package uses Java 8+ features that require core library desugaring to work on older Android versions.

### Solution Applied
Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to enable core library desugaring:

#### 1. Enabled Desugaring in CompileOptions
```kotlin
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true  // ← Added this line
}
```

#### 2. Added Desugaring Dependency
```kotlin
dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")
}
```

## What is Core Library Desugaring?

Core library desugaring allows you to use modern Java APIs (Java 8+) on older Android versions. It translates newer Java features into code that works on older Android versions.

### Benefits
- ✅ Use modern Java APIs
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Improved compatibility
- ✅ Access to newer language features

### Libraries That Require It
- `flutter_local_notifications` (version 18+)
- Many modern Firebase packages
- Other packages using Java 8+ features

## Changes Made

### File Modified
`android/app/build.gradle.kts`

### Lines Changed
- Line 16: Added `isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true`
- Lines 47-49: Added desugaring dependency

## Verification

After applying the fix:
1. ✅ Run `flutter clean`
2. ✅ Run `flutter run`
3. ✅ Build should complete successfully

## Additional Notes

### Minimum Requirements
- Android Gradle Plugin: 4.0+
- Gradle: 6.0+
- Java: 8+

### Compatibility
- Works with all Android versions (API 21+)
- No impact on iOS builds
- Compatible with all Flutter versions

## Common Issues After Fix

### If Build Still Fails
1. **Clean the project:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Invalidate Gradle cache:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean --no-daemon
   ./gradlew cleanBuildCache
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Update Gradle if needed:**
   Check `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
   Should have Gradle 7.0+ for best results

### If APK Size Increases
Core library desugaring adds ~200-300KB to APK size. This is normal and necessary for the functionality.
