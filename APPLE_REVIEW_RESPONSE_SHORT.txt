Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your questions. Here are the answers:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE?

Target Audience:
• Residents of Iraq (primarily Kurdistan region)
• Age 18-55, middle to upper-middle class
• People who want to purchase from international brands (Amazon, Zara, Adidas, etc.)
• Customers who cannot access international e-commerce directly

Why They Need This:
• International brands do NOT ship to Iraq
• No direct access to Amazon, Zara, Adidas, H&M, etc.
• Need reliable intermediary to purchase and deliver products
• Service operates exclusively in Iraq

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. HOW MUCH IS THE FEE, AND HOW DO USERS PAY?

Pricing Structure:

Our service charges for:
a) Product Price - Actual price on brand's official website
b) International Shipping - $2-$20 per item (varies by country/weight)
c) Customs & Taxes - Iraqi government import duties
d) Service Commission - 5-15% of product price
e) Local Delivery - Free in Erbil, small fee for other cities

Example:
$100 Amazon product = $100 (product) + $10 (shipping) + $15 (customs) + $10 (commission) + $0 (Erbil delivery) = $135 total

Payment Methods:

1. Cash on Delivery (Most Popular):
   - Customer pays when product delivered to their home
   - Available for customers with good credit standing
   - Most Iraqi customers prefer this method

2. Prepayment:
   - In-person at our Erbil office

Customer Account System:
- Customers have accounts with credit limits
- Good customers can order on credit and pay later
- Account balance tracks purchases and payments
- Admins manage customer credit

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Customer finds product on Amazon/Zara/etc and submits link through our app
2. We confirm price including all fees
3. We purchase from official brand website using our payment methods
4. We ship from origin country to Iraq and clear customs
5. We deliver to customer's home in Iraq
6. Customer pays total amount (cash on delivery or prepaid)

Revenue Model:
We earn from service commission (5-15%) and shipping markup.
We do NOT sell counterfeit products or impersonate brands.
