# 🔔 Firebase Cloud Messaging - Quick Reference

## ✅ Status: FULLY INTEGRATED & READY

Your Dolphin Shipping app has **complete push notification support** with automatic backend integration!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Add Firebase Config Files
```bash
# Android: Download google-services.json from Firebase Console
# Place at: android/app/google-services.json

# iOS: Download GoogleService-Info.plist from Firebase Console
# Add to Xcode: open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

### 2. Update Android Gradle
```kotlin
// android/build.gradle.kts - add to plugins:
id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.2" apply false

// android/app/build.gradle.kts - add to plugins:
id("com.google.gms.google-services")
```

### 3. Install & Run
```bash
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
flutter run
```

**That's it!** 🎉 Notifications are now working!

---

## 📱 What Happens Automatically

### ✅ On Login
```
User logs in → FCM token saved to database
```

### ✅ On Token Refresh
```
Token refreshes → New token saved to database
```

### ✅ On Logout
```
User logs out → FCM token deleted from database
```

**Zero manual intervention required!**

## 🎯 Sending Notifications from Backend

### To Specific User
```php
require_once 'fcm_sender.php';

notifyUser(
    $conn,
    $customerId,
    'Order Update',
    'Your order has been shipped!',
    ['orderId' => '123', 'type' => 'order_update']
);
```

### To All Users
```php
notifyAllUsers(
    $conn,
    'Special Offer',
    '50% off on shipping!',
    ['type' => 'promotion']
);
```

---

## 📊 Check Database

```sql
-- View active tokens
SELECT * FROM fcm_tokens WHERE is_active = 1;

-- Count tokens per user
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as devices 
FROM fcm_tokens 
WHERE is_active = 1 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Notifications

### From Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console → Cloud Messaging
2. Click "Send test message"
3. Get FCM token from app console logs
4. Paste token and send
5. You should receive notification! 🎉

### From Terminal
```bash
# Watch app logs
flutter run

# Look for:
# ✅ "FCM Token: xyz..."
# ✅ "FCM token saved to backend successfully"
```
