## 🎯 Sending Notifications from Backend

Once you have your Firebase Server Key:

```php
// Include the sender
require_once 'fcm_sender.php';

// Send to a user
notifyUser(
    $conn,
    $customerId,
    'Order Update',
    'Your order has been shipped!',
    ['orderId' => '123', 'type' => 'order_update']
);

// Send to all users
notifyAllUsers(
    $conn,
    'Special Offer',
    '50% off this week!',
    ['type' => 'promotion']
);
```

See `BACKEND_NOTIFICATION_SENDER.md` for complete PHP examples.

## 🔍 Verify Everything Works

### Check Database
```sql
-- See all active tokens
SELECT * FROM fcm_tokens WHERE is_active = 1;

-- Check your test user
SELECT * FROM fcm_tokens WHERE customer_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
```

### Test Login Flow
1. Run app
2. Login with test account
3. Check console: "FCM token saved to backend successfully"
4. Check database: Token should appear with is_active = 1

### Test Logout Flow
1. Go to Account screen
2. Tap Logout
3. Check console: "FCM token deleted from backend successfully"
4. Check database: Token should have is_active = 0

### Test Notifications
1. Get FCM token from console
2. Send test from Firebase Console
3. Should receive notification in app
4. Tap notification → App should open
