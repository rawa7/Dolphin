## Key Points for Apple

### Our Business Model (Keep This in Mind):

1. **We are NOT retailers** - We don't sell products
2. **We are intermediaries** - Like a personal shopper
3. **Target market:** Iraq (no direct access to international brands)
4. **Revenue:** Service commission (5-15%) + shipping markup
5. **Payment:** Cash on delivery (most common in Iraq)
6. **Legal:** Registered business with proper licenses

### Why We're NOT Violating IP Rights:

1. ‚úÖ We buy from official brand websites
2. ‚úÖ We don't sell counterfeit products
3. ‚úÖ We don't claim to be the brands
4. ‚úÖ We're transparent about our intermediary role
5. ‚úÖ Similar to approved apps (Aramex Shop & Ship, MyUS, etc.)

---

## If Apple Asks Follow-Up Questions

Be prepared to provide:

1. **Business registration documents** (from Iraq)
2. **Import/export license** (customs clearance documentation)
3. **Sample transaction records** (showing we buy from official websites)
4. **Screenshots of official website purchases** (Amazon order confirmations, etc.)
5. **Customer testimonials** (showing legitimacy)

Have these ready if Apple requests them.

---

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT:
- Remove the disclaimers from the app
- Change your business model explanation
- Remove the "How it works" information

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Be responsive to Apple's questions
- Provide clear, honest answers
- Show you're running a legitimate business
- Emphasize you serve an underserved market (Iraq)

## Questions to Expect from Apple

Based on similar app reviews, Apple might ask:

1. ‚úÖ **"Who is your target audience?"** - ANSWERED
2. ‚úÖ **"How do you charge fees?"** - ANSWERED
3. ‚ùì **"Do you have permission from brands?"** - Answer: "We don't need permission. We're purchasing as regular customers from their official websites, not partnering with them."
4. ‚ùì **"How do you verify authenticity?"** - Answer: "All products purchased from official brand websites (Amazon.com, Zara.com, etc.), not third-party sellers."
5. ‚ùì **"What if a brand objects?"** - Answer: "We haven't received objections because we purchase legitimately and don't claim to represent them."

Be ready to answer these clearly and professionally.

Your responses clearly explain:
