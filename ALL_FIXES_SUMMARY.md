## Files Modified

### Android
1. `android/build.gradle.kts` - Added buildscript with Google Services
2. `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Added desugaring + Google Services plugin

### iOS
1. `ios/` folder - Completely recreated
2. `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Firebase configuration
3. `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Background modes for notifications

### No Changes Needed
- âœ… Flutter code (main.dart, services, screens)
- âœ… Firebase Notification Service
- âœ… API integration

## Testing Status

### Current Build
ðŸ”„ Running on iOS Simulator (iPhone 16 Pro)

### Expected Results
Once build completes:
- âœ… Firebase initializes successfully
- âœ… FCM token generated
- âœ… Device ID retrieved
- âœ… No "stuck on loading" issue
- âœ… Notifications ready to work

### What to Test
1. App launches successfully
2. Login saves FCM token to database
3. Check console for: "FCM Token: xyz..."
4. Check console for: "FCM token saved to backend successfully"
5. Logout deletes FCM token
6. Send test notification from Firebase Console
