Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding Guideline 5.2.2 - Legal.

We have carefully reviewed your concerns and made significant changes to our app to ensure full compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.

CHANGES MADE IN VERSION 2.0.0:
-------------------------------

1. REMOVED all third-party brand names and logos
   - No Amazon, AliExpress, Shein, Temu, or other brand references
   - No brand filters or brand selection features
   - No third-party trademarks or logos displayed

2. UPDATED our business model
   - Dolphin now has our own product catalog
   - We sell our own products directly to customers
   - All products shown are Dolphin's inventory

3. REDESIGNED the Store interface
   - Products display: image, name, category, price, and order button only
   - Clean, professional product catalog
   - No external links or third-party references

WHAT YOU WILL SEE:
------------------
The test account provided is a standard customer account. When reviewing the app, you will see:

- Home: Welcome screen with order statistics
- Store: Our product catalog (generic products with categories like Electronics, Fashion, etc.)
- My Orders: Order history and tracking
- Account: Profile and settings

All products are presented as Dolphin's own merchandise. There are no references to third-party services or brands anywhere in the app.

BUSINESS CLARIFICATION:
----------------------
Dolphin operates an e-commerce platform selling products directly to customers in Iraq. We manage our own inventory and fulfill orders for our customers. This is a standard online shopping app where users can:
- Browse our product catalog
- Place orders for products they want
- Track their order status
- Manage their account

We believe these changes fully address the concerns raised and ensure complete compliance with App Store Review Guidelines, specifically Guideline 5.2.2.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to bringing Dolphin to iOS users.

Best regards,
Dolphin Team
